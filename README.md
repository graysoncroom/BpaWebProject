# BpaWebProject

<h2>My group and I are working on a Web Design project for BPA.</h2>

No dependencies are in this project. I do not plan on using anything other than fontawesome potentially.
(does google-fonts count as a dependency? I totally use it.)

<h3>Check out the current working version of this project at: https://graysoncroom.github.io/BpaWebProject/</h3>

If you have suggestions or comments of kind either email me at
grayson.croom@gmail.com or start an issue board to get others who may also
share your opinion talking about it. Make sure to check the issue board before making your own as to minimize duplicates.

Project Deadline: No idea
