# BpaWebProject

<h1>My group and I are working on a Web Design project for BPA.</h1>

At the moment it includes a couple dependencies such as:
<ul>
	<li>Bootstrap</li>
	<li>jQuery</li>
</ul>

I will use these to get a sence of what is going to happen, and soon thereafter
cut ties with these awesome tools.

If you have suggestions or comments of kind either email me at
grayson.croom@gmail.com or start an issue board to get others who may also
share your opinion talking about it. Make sure to check the issue board before making your own as to minimize duplicates.

Project Deadline: NULL
