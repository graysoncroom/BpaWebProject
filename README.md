# BpaWebProject

<h2>My group and I are working on a Web Design project for BPA.</h2>

<h3>UPDATE: We placed 3/6 in Regionals and are going to state!!

No dependencies are in this project. I do not plan on using anything other than google fonts.

<h3>Check out the current working version of this project at: https://graysoncroom.github.io/BpaWebProject/</h3>

The only thing that you may experiance is a little wait ( 8 seconds tops ) for the background image to load due to the high resolution of jpeg images.

This project is mobile responsive with a desktop-first approach. Colors and page layout are subject to change at any given time. This site does not own any Images or other media and these things may be subject to copywrite laws, but due to the educational element to this project I don't really care. Cudos to the creators where ever you are.

<h4>Currently works with the following browsers</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Google Chrome</li>
  <li>Firefox</li>
  <li>Safari</li>
  <li>IE 10+</li>
</ul>

If you have suggestions or comments of kind either email me at grayson.croom@gmail.com or start an issue board to get others who may also share your opinion talking about it. Make sure to check the issue board before making your own as to minimize duplicates.



Project Deadline: January 18, 2017
