# BpaWebProject

<h2>Aaron Hueske and I are representing The Woodlands High School BPA chapter in 'Website Design Team'</h2>

<h4>UPDATE: We are going to state after placing in third (out of six) at regionals!</h4>

There is NOTHING in this project that is not ours. The pictures were taken by my partneer (background included),
the design of the website is our okay attempt at being creative, the server is hosted on open source web server
software on linux, and the website itself was coded without any help from libraries (this means no jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.)
This is my first 'real' website and I learned a shit ton from this project (like why OOP is never to be ignored).

<h4>Check out the latest version of the site at (may be buggy): https://graysoncroom.github.io/BpaWebProject/</h4>

<h4>Currently works with the following browsers</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Google Chrome</li>
  <li>Firefox</li>
  <li>Safari</li>
  <li>IE 10+</li>
</ul>

If you have suggestions or comments of kind either email me at grayson.croom@gmail.com or start an issue board to get others who may also share your opinion talking about it. Make sure to check the issue board before making your own as to minimize duplicates.
