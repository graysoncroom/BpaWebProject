				<h4>Grayson Croom</h4>
				<h5>Website Developer and Designer</h5>
				<p>I am the tech behind this site. My hobbies include programming and playing lacrosse. Computers have interested me since before middle school, but at first this was limited to computer hardware. I would build computers to game on them. About a year ago I started to dive into the world of programming. Ever since then I have been trying to learn as much information about coding as can, as well as build a couple cool things along the way!</p>
