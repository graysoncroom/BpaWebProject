			<p>
				In this project, we will be describing and teaching you how to correctly put together a skateboard rack. This is a very simple project so long as you are okay working with everyday tools. At the end you will have the perfect place to hang all your longboards and skateboards!

			<h2>Setting Up the Project</h2>
			<h3>Step <span id="stepNum1">1</span>:</h3>
			<a class="btt" href="#top">Goto Navigation</a>
			<img class="image right" id="listSlider1"></img>
			<p class="steps1 steps" id="step11">
				Using your screwdriver, remove the 4 screws holding the side panel in place. Place the panel in a safe position, and keep the screws in your possession.
			</p>
			<p class="steps1 steps" id="step12">
				Check to see if your computer came with the motherboard already installed. If it is move on to the next step. Otherwise read the instructions that came with your computer case on where to install the mounting hardware. All you have to do is line up these holes with the ones on the motherboard and screw it in. Screw it in tight but not too tight as to keep the motherboard from snaping.
			</p>
			<p class="steps1 steps" id="step13">
				Every computer case is different. For this final step you need to located all the screws, figure out where each one will be going, and examine the locations where your manual says each part will go. In the next slide we will be going through each step, but if you do these things it will make locating your parts much easier come time to build your computer.

			<h3>Step <span id="stepNum2">1</span>:</h3>
			<img class="image right" id="listSlider2"></img>
			<p class="steps2 steps" id="step21">
				Install the hard drive(s), making sure to plug the Sata cable into the hard drive. Push the hard drive(s) into the port until it clicks in place. The hard drives store data from the computer.
			</p>
			<p class="steps2 steps" id="step22">
				Next, install the RAM by lining up the component with the port. Push it into the port until it clicks, and push the alternate side of it to make sure it is properly secured. RAM is the computing power, and allows you to run different programs and processes.
			</p>
			<p class="steps2 steps" id="step23">
				To install the CPU, line up the triangle on the corner of the CPU and the triangle on the baseplate. There are levers on each side of the baseplate, raise these so that the CPU can be mounted. Now simply pull the levers downward to secure the component. The CPU is a vital component of the computer, it conducts the “brainwork”.
			</p>
			<p class="steps2 steps" id="step24">
				Now to install the cooling system. The cooling system is two pieces connected by tubes. The smaller of the components has to be attached over the CPU. All you need to do is line up the piece and screw it in place. The second part of the cooling system contains the fan, which has to be mounted to the side of the computer case. Hold it in place and insert screws to ensure stability. It is essential to have a properly installed cooling system, in order to maintain optimal conditions for the computer.
			</p>
			<p class="steps2 steps" id="step25">
				The final step is installing the graphics card. To install the graphics card, simply line up the ports with the corresponding locations on the computer and slide it in. Securely fasten the graphics card with screws on the outside of the computer case. Now put the case cover back on and you are all done!
